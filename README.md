## Convert a Mailman3 Database from SQLite to MariaDB

In the standard installation under Debian, Mailman3 uses an SQLite database. At some point, however, you will want to switch to a real database. The mechanism described in the Mailman documentation does not refer to Mailman3 as it is delivered by the distributions.
